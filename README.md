# IPTriageTool
Note: I have made this redundant with:  https://github.com/jkerai1/VirusTotal-IP-powershell a much more powerful tool.

A tool to quickly triage multiple IPs using VirusTotal,AlienVault OTX and WhoIs
 
 
 One version is .bat (batch) and one is Python 

 for paste you need paste.exe see https://www.c3scripts.com/tutorials/msdos/paste.html  
 
 
Good Idea to create a shortcut to the batch script so it can be executed globally with a hotkey ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55988027/120716927-a0784900-c4be-11eb-9b65-3f84724d1565.png)
